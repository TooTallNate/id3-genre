API
---

### genre(String|Number value) â†’ Number|String

If a `Number` is passed in, then the byte number is looked in in the genres table
and the matching `String` genre is returned, or `"Unknown"` if a value &lt; 0 or
&gt; 147. This is useful for reading the ID3v1 __genre__ byte for human display.

If a `String` is passed in, then the genre name is looked up in the genres table,
and the byte number for the given genre is returned, or `null` if an unknown genre
is given. This is useful for getting the byte number when saving ID3v1 tags.
